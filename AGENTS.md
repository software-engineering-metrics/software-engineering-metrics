# AGENTS

Guidance for AI agents and human contributors working in this repository. Read
this first. It is short on purpose; the details live in the linked files.

## What this repo is

A working book about measuring software engineering well: 45 chapters across 8
parts, plus front matter and appendices. The writing is deliberately warm,
plain, and opinionated, and it follows a strict house style. Every metric
family carries its own gaming vector and guardrail, because the book's central
premise (chapter 1.2) is [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law):
a measure that becomes a target stops being a good measure. This repository
holds the book's content and specification; it is rendered into a website by
the separate `software-engineering-metrics.github.io` repository.

## Golden rules (do not break these)

1. **No em-dashes.** Never use "—" (U+2014). Use a comma, colon, parentheses, or
   two sentences. En-dashes "–" are allowed only in numeric ranges.
2. **No stock LLM phrasing.** No "not only ... but also", "but also", or
   "load-bearing"; no "It's important to note", "In today's fast-paced world",
   and similar filler.
3. **Follow the chapter template.** Content chapters use the fixed section order
   in [`docs/contributing/chapter-template.md`](docs/contributing/chapter-template.md).
4. **Define terms on first use** and **link key concepts to Wikipedia** on first
   mention. Real references only; never fabricate a work or a URL.
5. **The spec is the source of truth.** It lives at the repository root in
   [`spec/`](spec/index.md), not under `docs/`, because the book (not the site)
   is what it governs. Structure is declared in
   [`spec/structure.md`](spec/structure.md); style is declared in
   [`spec/conventions.md`](spec/conventions.md). Change the spec and
   the chapters together.
6. **Tests must pass.** Run `just test` before you consider a change done.
7. **Name the gaming vector.** A chapter that presents a metric without also
   presenting how it gets gamed and what pairs with it to catch that is not
   finished.

The full, enforceable version of rules 1 through 5 is
[`docs/contributing/style-rules.md`](docs/contributing/style-rules.md) and
[`spec/conventions.md`](spec/conventions.md).

## Repository layout

- `docs/` : everything the published site contains, rendered elsewhere.
  - `docs/chapters/` : the chapter files, named `PP-CC-slug.md` with a zero-padded, dash-separated, sortable prefix (the chapter number in the text stays dotted, e.g. `2.1`).
  - `docs/front-matter/` : the opening essay, introduction, and table of contents.
  - `docs/examples/` : small illustrative examples (a metrics charter, a dashboard spec).
  - `docs/contributing/` : contributor and agent guides, plus shared snippets.
  - `docs/project/` : project documentation and the changelog.
- `spec/` : the specification-driven source of truth (structure, conventions,
  roadmap). It is hand-authored and not published to the site; the book is
  what it governs.
- `tools/` : `gen_nav.py`, which generates the README TOC, the site home page,
  the contents page, and the subject index; and `stats.py`, the Markdown
  stats report behind `just stats`.
- `tests/` : `validate.py`, the enforcement suite.
- `.github/workflows/` : `test.yml` (PR checks), `links.yml` (weekly external
  link check).
- `justfile`, `pyproject.toml` : the task runner and the Python dev-tooling
  dependencies (codespell; see `just spell`).

## Task guides

- Writing or editing a chapter: [`docs/contributing/authoring.md`](docs/contributing/authoring.md)
- Regenerating navigation after structure changes: [`docs/contributing/navigation.md`](docs/contributing/navigation.md)
- Running and understanding the tests: [`docs/contributing/testing.md`](docs/contributing/testing.md)

## Shared snippets

- Blank chapter template: [`docs/contributing/chapter-template.md`](docs/contributing/chapter-template.md)
- Style rules (enforceable): [`docs/contributing/style-rules.md`](docs/contributing/style-rules.md)
- Part index: [`docs/contributing/part-index.md`](docs/contributing/part-index.md)

## The usual workflow

1. Read the relevant task guide above.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the request.
3. If you changed the set of chapters, update `spec/structure.md` and run
   `just nav`.
4. Run `just test`. Fix anything it reports. `just spell` catches spelling
   issues the suite does not; CI runs it too.
5. Update `docs/project/changelog.md` with a one-line summary of what changed.

Every file in `docs/contributing/` is kept small so it loads cheaply into an
agent's context.
