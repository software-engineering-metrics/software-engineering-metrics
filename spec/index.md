# Software Engineering Metrics: Specification

This is the source of truth for the book. The book is a **book**. It is made
of **chapters**. The chapters are **Markdown**. The words in those chapters are
the product. Everything else in the repository exists to serve them.

If you are an author or an agent about to change anything, read this file
first. It tells you what the book is, how spec-driven development works here,
and which rules you may not break.

## This is a book, not a website

The book is written and lives as Markdown chapters. It is authored, read,
reviewed, and versioned as prose. The published website is a rendering of that
prose, not the thing itself.

- The **source of truth** is the Markdown in `docs/chapters/`, the front
  matter, the appendices, and this specification.
- The **website is a side effect.** It is rendered from the same Markdown by
  the separate `software-engineering-metrics.github.io` repository. How that
  works, what it produces, and how it deploys is that repository's concern.
  Nothing in that layer decides what the book says.
- If the site and the book ever disagree, the **book wins.** You could delete
  the rendering repository entirely and still have the whole book intact in
  plain text. That is the test of what is authoritative here.

So write for a reader holding a book, chapter by chapter. Do not write for a
navigation sidebar, a search box, or a theme. Those are downstream.

## What spec-driven development means here

The spec comes first, the chapters conform to it, and the tests enforce it.

1. **Declare intent in the spec.** What chapters exist, in what order, and
   what shape each chapter takes is decided here and in the companion spec
   files, not improvised chapter by chapter.
2. **Bring the chapters into line.** Chapters are written and edited to
   satisfy the spec. A chapter that does not follow the template or the house
   style is a defect, not a variation.
3. **Enforce mechanically what can be enforced.** `tests/validate.py` checks
   the structure and the rules that a machine can check. `just test` must pass
   before any change is considered done.

The rule that ties these together: **change the spec and the chapters in the
same change.** Never let the manifest, the conventions, and the actual chapter
files drift apart. If you want to change what the book is or how it reads,
edit the spec first, then make the chapters match.

## The specification files

This overview is the entry point for the **content**. The enforceable detail
lives in three companion files.

- **[structure.md](structure.md)** is the canonical manifest: every part and
  every chapter, with its decimal number, title, and file name. It is the sole
  authority for which chapters exist and how they are numbered. The test suite
  checks that the files on disk match it exactly.
- **[conventions.md](conventions.md)** is the writing and format
  specification: the numbering scheme, the chapter template, the house style,
  and the hard rules the tests enforce.
- **[oxford-spelling.md](oxford-spelling.md)** is the spelling standard:
  Oxford spelling (British English with `-ize` endings), with the word lists
  and the rules for the spelling sweep.
- **[roadmap.md](roadmap.md)** is the authoring backlog and the adoption
  checklists organizations can use to put a metrics program into practice.

The **rendering** side effects (the published website, its navigation, and its
deployment) are the concern of the separate
`software-engineering-metrics.github.io` repository. Keep the two apart on
purpose: this file and its companions govern the book; that repository governs
the machine that renders it.

## What this book is

A working book of practices for measuring software engineering: how to choose
metrics that reflect real outcomes rather than activity, the standard
frameworks (DORA, SPACE), the metric families that matter (delivery and flow,
developer experience, code and quality, product and business, reliability and
security), and how to run a metrics program that improves a team rather than
policing it. Chapter 1.2 sets the guardrail that governs every other chapter:
[Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), the fact that
any measure, once it becomes a target, stops being a good measure. Every
metric family in this book is presented with that guardrail attached, not as
an afterthought but as a condition of using the metric at all.

## The shape of the book

The book is organized as numbered parts, each made of numbered chapters.

- Parts are whole numbers (1 through 9). Chapters are decimals within a part,
  for example `2.3`.
- Chapter **N.0** is the part introduction. Chapters **N.1, N.2, ...** are the
  content chapters. Numbering within a part is contiguous and starts at N.0.
- Chapter files live in `docs/chapters/` and are named `PP-CC-slug.md` with a
  zero-padded, dash-separated, sortable numeric prefix (two-digit part,
  two-digit chapter; the N.0 introduction is `PP-00`), for example
  `02-00-flow-metrics.md` and `02-01-the-flow-framework.md`,
  so a plain lexical sort lists the chapters in reading order. The slug is
  lowercase with dashes.
- The first heading of every chapter file is `# N.M Title` using the unpadded,
  dotted chapter number, and that number must match the file's `PP-CC` prefix.
- Part 9 is the appendices: glossary, a formulas reference, checklists,
  templates, a maturity self-assessment, references, and an index.

The authoritative list of parts and chapters is [structure.md](structure.md).
This overview never restates that list, so the two can never fall out of sync.

## The chapter template

Every content chapter (N.1 and up, in Parts 1 through 8) uses these sections,
in this order. All are required and checked.

1. `# N.M Title`
2. `## Overview and motivation`
3. `## Key principles`
4. `## Recommendations`
5. `## Trade-offs: pros and cons`
6. `## Questions to discuss with your team`
7. `## Sector lens`
8. `## Examples`
9. `## Business case: motivations, ROI, and TCO`
10. `## Anti-patterns and pitfalls`
11. `## Maturity model`
12. `## Ideas for discussion`
13. `## Key takeaways`
14. `## References and further reading`

Part introductions (N.0) use a lighter shape: two or three framing paragraphs,
a `## Chapters in this part` list, and a `## How these chapters interrelate`
section. The full definition of each section, including what belongs inside
it, is in [conventions.md](conventions.md).

## Golden rules

These come from the house style and are not negotiable. The full, enforceable
version is in [conventions.md](conventions.md).

1. **No em-dashes.** Never use the em-dash character (U+2014). Use a comma, a
   colon, parentheses, or two sentences. En-dashes are allowed only in numeric
   ranges.
2. **No stock LLM phrasing.** No "not only ... but also", no "load-bearing",
   no "It's important to note", and no similar filler.
3. **Follow the chapter template.** Content chapters use the fixed section
   order above.
4. **Define terms on first use, and link key concepts to Wikipedia** on first
   mention. Real references only; never fabricate a work or a URL.
5. **The spec is the source of truth.** Structure is declared in
   [structure.md](structure.md); style is declared in
   [conventions.md](conventions.md). Change the spec and the chapters
   together.
6. **Tests must pass.** Run `just test` before you consider a change done.
7. **Every metric family carries its own guardrail.** A chapter that presents
   a metric without also presenting how it gets gamed and what pairs with it
   to catch that gaming is not finished (see chapter 1.2).

## The usual workflow

1. Decide the change as a change to the book: which chapters, which sections,
   which words.
2. Edit the spec first if the change touches structure, numbering, or
   conventions.
3. Edit or write the chapters to match, following the template and the house
   style.
4. If the set of chapters changed, regenerate the navigation artifacts with
   `just nav`. That regeneration is downstream bookkeeping; the book is
   already correct before it runs.
5. Run `just test`. Fix anything it reports.
6. Record the change in `docs/project/changelog.md`.
